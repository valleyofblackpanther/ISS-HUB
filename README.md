# Node.js Cron Job Project

## Overview

This Node.js project is designed to schedule and run cron jobs for various automated tasks. It utilizes the `node-cron` package to set up tasks that can perform actions like sending emails, running database cleanups, or any other time-based jobs.

## Features

- **Task Scheduling**: Schedule tasks to run at specific intervals using cron syntax.
- **Flexible Timing**: Configure cron jobs to run at various frequencies, from every minute to once a year.
- **Background Jobs**: Run tasks in the background without user intervention.
- **Scalable**: Easily add new cron jobs as the project grows.
- **Logging**: Includes a logging system to keep track of job execution and errors.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm (usually comes with Node.js)

### Installing

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/valleyofblackpanther/cron/
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd cron
   ```
3. Install NPM packages:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

### Configuration

Before starting the project, you need to set up the necessary environment variables and configurations:

1. Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the necessary details.
2. Configure the cron jobs in the `cron-jobs.js` file (or wherever you keep your cron configuration).

### Running the Application

To run the cron jobs, execute:

```sh
npm start
```

This will start the Node.js application and the cron jobs will be scheduled to run at the times you've configured.

## Cron Job Examples

```javascript
// Example of a cron job that runs every minute
const cron = require('node-cron');

cron.schedule('* * * * *', () => {
  console.log('Running a task every minute');
});
```

## Testing

To test your cron jobs, run:

```sh
npm test
```

Make sure to write tests specifically for your cron tasks to ensure they execute as expected.

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system if necessary.
